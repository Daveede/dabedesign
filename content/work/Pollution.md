Pollution is an environmental awareness campaign.
It aims to raise awareness of the consequences and impacts on the food chain.
A brand identity and a series of posters were created for the campaign.

## Brand Identity

## Manifesti

After creating the Brand Identity I took a series of photos at the San Benedetto market in Cagliari to make the problem of pollution in the food chain as close as possible to the citizens of the city.

With the help of Photoshop and Blender I set the photos in a utopian future, where the world we live in is so polluted that food and meat are made of plastic and garbage.
