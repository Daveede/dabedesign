dabe.design is built with hugo, an open source framework that allows the generation of static sites.
The theme created for dabe.design uses Bootstrap 5 which makes it a mobile-first and responsive site.

Hugo uses the markdown language to create articles, the absence of a real database makes it a fast and flexible framework.
